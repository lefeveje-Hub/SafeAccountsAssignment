### Safe Accounts Assignment
## Point-in-time analysis of Safe Accounts via the Dune Analytics Youtube training. 

ðŸ“Š This dashboard was created by me following Dune's Youtube series using Safe Wallets as a case study to demonstrate how to conduct point-in-time analysis for a topic.

ðŸŸ  Scope: only looking at Safes created in the past 6 months on Ethereum mainnet and only considering ETH and ERC20 tokens and not ERC721 or ERC1155.

# Concepts and Metrics 

Point Analysis: analysis done for one point in time, as opposed to trend analysis done over a period of time. E.g. for Feb 12 as opposed to for the period of Jan 1 to Feb 12.

Volume or Liquidity: used interchangeably here, defined as the inflow plus outflow liquidity to the account. More specifically, this looks at the absolute USD value of the total transfer in and transfer out amount for ETH and all ERC20 tokens (that are available in Dune's prices.usd table)
